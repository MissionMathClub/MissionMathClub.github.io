Q: Will the answers also be limited to 0-999 like the AIME?

A: No, the answers will always be an integer (potentially including negative integers), but won't necessarily be in the range 0-999.

Q: What if I'm not old enough to have a discord account?

A: You can email us at mathclubmsj@gmail.com and we can put you on the Zoom option. 

Q: Can I take both warrior and champion?

A: No, sorry, since there will be some problem overlap on the divisions. The problems will be released after the competition so you can see them then.

Q: Will the problems be from past MAA exams?

A: No, all the problems are original, never-seen-before super duper cool epic problems written by the MSJ math club officers 

Q: How do we submit our answers? Like would there be a website which you will create for the tournament, or some other method?

A: We plan on using google forms for answer submission and all the submissions will be manually graded.

Q: What is the format of the test?

A: Problems will be provided via a digital pdf and you will submit your answers through a google form (most likely). You may use any of your own scratch paper. You do not need to submit your work. For more info on the test, please check the first post on the home page.
