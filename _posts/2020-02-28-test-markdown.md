We are the officers of the math club at Mission San Jose High School, and at **1:30 PST on July 18th, 2021**, we will be hosting an online individual math competition: Summer Mission Math Tournament! (**SMMT**). There will be prizes for the top positions.

The competition will have 2 divisions: Warrior and Champion, and you can only participate in one of them.

- **Warrior Division**: The test will feature 15 problems, and you'll be given 69 minutes to solve these problems. The difficulty spans the range of the AMC with a couple of early AIME difficulty problems towards the end. The test will feel much like your average AMC.

- **Champion Division**: The test will feature 10 problems, and you'll be given 96  minutes to solve these problems, with the difficulty ranging from mid-AMC to late AIME. If you took the AIME, then this test will feel much like a faster-paced version of it.

If you're interested, sign up [here](https://tinyurl.com/SummerMMT2021) and join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/BnqWpAswfZ) where we'll be hosting the competition! The deadline to sign up is 11:59 PM on July 17.
